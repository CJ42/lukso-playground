# Basic Sample Hardhat Project For Lukso's L14/16

In order to deploy smart contracts to Lukso's L14 or L16 chains, we advise you to use the `hardhat-deploy` plugin

Please check out, this [PR](https://github.com/lukso-network/lukso-playground/tree/main/hardhat-deploy) in order to see what has to be updated when switching to `hardhat-deploy` plugin deployment.

Once your files updated in order to deploy, just run the following command:
`npx hardhat deploy --tags [NameOfYourSmartContract] --network luksoL16`
